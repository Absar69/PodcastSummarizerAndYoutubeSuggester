            "\" The Joe Rogan experience some happy little place where you know, someone's feeding you peeled grapes that isn't what it is It's it's more like it's my more like victory on the honorable battlefield or something like that Yeah the the perception that people have of ultimate success and ultimate happiness is It seems motivated by what they don't have rather than an understanding of what success and happiness really is Their idea is that one day I'm gonna go and I'm gonna be in my golden years And I'm just gonna be able to sit around and do nothing and tell everybody to fuck off You won't be happy at all Yeah I talked to to one of the people that I was working with who had a like a vision for retirement said well What's your vision for retirement? Well, I see myself in the beach You know some tropical country drinking margaritas and I thought first that's not a plan. That's a travel poster It's like okay. Let's let's walk through this. Alright, so you go down to this tropical country And you go sit on the beach and you have a margarita. It's like, okay. Well, how many margaritas like ten? Okay, so gonna do that what I'm gonna do that for six months. You'll be dead Yeah, well, you'll be this like pathetic sunburned like fat. Yeah unhappy hungover Yeah, yeah, it's like that's your vision So how long can you have a margarita on a beach? Like maybe you can do that once every six months for like ten minutes something like that. It's not a vision It's true, but when you are working and slaving away you think about that beach with your feet up Yeah, and the waiter comes over would you like another margarita? Mr. Peterson? Yeah. Yes, I would Absolutely Right, exactly, but it's it's like this 16 year old fantasy of paradise It's like well, and it just doesn't work out So yeah and and the thing that the thing is is that the thing that sustains people through life really is The lifting of a worthwhile burden it's something like that and it's partly because we're social animals, right? It's like we're evolved to be useful to the people around us because they're much more likely to let us live if we're like that Yeah, so and and it's been very fun talking to especially talking to young men about this is like Well, and that's the other thing too is I think the world the world is full of darkness let's say and We could say each of us have a little bit of light and if we're talking about The world is a lesser place if you do not reveal From within yourself what you have to reveal and the fact that the world is a lesser place actually turns out not to be trivial Like if you want everything you could be more people will die more people will suffer more evil will be unconstrained More tyranny will reign more chaos will reign more chaos will reign And the fact that the world is a lesser place is actually not to be trivial More evil will be unconstrained more tyranny will reign more chaos will remain Chaotic and dangerous all of that Do you mean this by this in the sense of like the old proverb of the wings of a butterfly fluttering become a hurricane? It's it's it's something similar to that, but it can even be more local It's like your family is more messed up than it could be if you were less messed up than you are, right? So if you just got your act together like 10% more your family would be 1% better, right? It's like well Do it and that would ripple off into the people that they interact. Yes. Yes, and it ripples and it ripples fast Yes, that's the other thing that's so cool. Is that like people think well There's seven billion of us and each of us is just this separate dust moat like floating in the cosmos And what the hell difference does it make what you do? Anyways, it's like that is not how we're connected it's like you're the center of a network and You know, well, you know way more people than this, but let's say typically You know a thousand you're going to know a thousand people in your life well enough to have an impact on them Okay, and each of those thousand people is going to know a thousand people So you're one step from a million and two steps from a billion and we are networked technically that that's how human interactions work And so when you do something that you shouldn't do it's worse than you think And when you do something that you should do, it's better than you think And so you think well, this is why i've been telling people clean up your room It's like well your room is actually networked too. It's not that easy to clean up your room to set it So you want your room to be set up so that when you walk in there it tells you to be better than you generally are It's organized. It's got direction. Everything's in its place. You try to do that in a chaotic household You know, i've watched people do this because I had students do these sorts of things as assignments. I'd say look Pick a small moral goal clean up your room and just write down what happens as a consequence So maybe these are students in a chaotic household. The whole place is a bloody mess No one's taking any responsibility for anything and so they decide they're going to start to clean up their room And then the people in the household notice. Well, the first thing they do is get pissed off. It's like who do you think you are? Like you think you're better than us? Like why do you think this is worthwhile? Who made who died made you god all of that? So just by trying to organize this little part of their life they immediately run into the people whose Actions they're casting in a dim light by trying to improve themselves to some degree They might have to have like a thorough war in their household to be allowed to do something as simple as keep the room orderly They find out very rapidly that a that's way more difficult than it sounds and b that the consequences of it are far more Far-reaching than people think so that's quite fun you know, because maybe part of it is is that Like everything around you is full of potential Everything maybe more potential than you could ever possibly utilize And so maybe all you have is this little rat hole of a room in some rundown place in the world. It's like Fix it up There's more there than you think see what happens if you fix it up and you'll fix yourself up simultaneously because you have to get disciplined In order to fix up the room Then you have a fixed up room and you'll be a more fixed up person It's like you think that nothing will happen as a consequence of that. It's like all hell will break loose as a consequence of that It's really worth trying it is worth trying and it's it's a concept that seems alien to people But if you think about it, it makes sense Well people don't take what they have right in front of them seriously enough. It's like the wasting time thing They don't do the arithmetic, you know, and they they also don't understand They devalue what they have right in front of them like another Another client I worked with was having a hard time putting his kid to bed at night And so we we did the arithmetic It's like well i'm fighting with my kid for 45 minutes a night trying to get him to go to bed Okay, so let's analyze that. All right. So what does that mean? Well, it means that both of you end the day upset That's not so good because why would you want that? It means that you're spending 45 minutes fighting when you could spend 20 minutes doing something positive like reading to him say Means that you don't get to spend that time with your wife So she's not very happy with you plus you're annoyed because you don't see her plus you blame it on the kid because he's the proximal Cause it's like that's pretty damn ugly And then and then let's do the arithmetic. It's like seven days a week 45 minutes a day. Let's call that five hours 20 hours a week 240 hours in a year. It's six you're spending a month and a half of work weeks fighting with your four-year-old son You think you're gonna like them? You don't like anyone you spend a month and a half a year fighting with it's a bad idea Fix it It's important Get him to bed make it peaceful you do it like these things that repeat every single day That's a motif in this book too. Your life isn't margaritas on a beach in in jamaica That happens now and then those are exceptions. Your life is how your wife greets you at the door when you come home every day Because that's like 10 minutes a day Your life is how you treat each other over the breakfast table because that's an hour and a half or an hour every single day You get those mundane things right those things you do every day you concentrate on them and you make them pristine It's like you got 80 percent of your life put together These little things that are right in front of us They're not little that's the first thing they are not little and they're hard to set right And if you set them right it has a rippling effect and and fast too way faster than people think You\"\n"
